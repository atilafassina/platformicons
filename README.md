## Publishing Changes 
Platformicons uses GitHub Actions to publish changes. You don’t need to update the version in `package.json`, that’s done automatically.

1. Make a change
2. Merge with Master
3. Head to the [Release workflow](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons/actions/workflows/release.yml) and then run the workflow
4. This will automatically create a new branch that’s ready to be deployed
